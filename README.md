# openCloud
A flask app that you can self host to store and manage your files, and it also includes a web terminal for full control over your server

## Setup
- set user passowrds in users.txt (ik it is clear text but ill deal with hashing later), i the format like user:password and a newline for another user
- set your key in the secret_key.txt file
- you also need to set your domain in the app.py file i am sorry but cors is soooo anoying
- and of course you need to run """pip install -r requirements.txt""" hopefully i spelled that right
I hope it works well
