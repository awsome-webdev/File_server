# File_server
A flask app that you can easily host on your server to manage and download your files like google drive. 
- still need to add downloading single files
- i am going to add a setup wizard that will help write to all of these files adn install

## Setup
- set user passowrds in users.txt (ik it is clear text but ill deal with hashing later)
- set your key in the secret_key.txt file
